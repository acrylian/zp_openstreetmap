zp_openstreetmap
==============

A [Zenphoto](http://www.zenphoto.org) plugin for displaying an OpenStreetMap with the embeded geo coordinates of an image or the images of an album as markers.

Alternatively you can also create custom maps.

Usage
----------
Copy the theme files (file and folder) to your `plugins` folder and enable the plugin.

###Standard theme usage
Place the function `printOpenStreetMap()` on your theme's `album.php` and/or `image.php` where you wish the map to appear. If there is no metadata available the map will not be printed.

###Custom maps beyond current image/album
#### Individual images or albums
You can also create maps from any image or album using the zpOpenStreetMap class (see the file itself for more detailed documentation on which properties you can set):

```php
$albumobj = newAlbum('<albumname>');
$object = newImage($albumobj,'<imagefilename>'); 
$map = new zpOpenStreetMap(NULL,$object);
$map->printMap();
```
You can do the same with an album object to get the geodata from all of its images so they are placed as markers on the map.

Or you can use the template function: 

```php
printOpenStreetMap(NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', NULL, $object);`
```

#### Custom maps based on custom geodata
Custom maps without any image or album involved work the same way. Just passing an array to the custructor. This array must be structured like this:

```php
$geodata = array(
	  array(
	    'lat' => <latitude>,
	    'long' => <longitude>,
	    'title' => 'some title for the marker popup',
	    'desc' => 'some description for the marker popup',
	    'thumb' => 'some html for the marker popup' // e.g. <img>  
	    'current' => 0 // 1 to hightight this marker with another color. Intended for the current image on album marker view but can be used otherwise, too
	  )
);
$map = new zpOpenStreetMap($geodata);
$map->printMap();

//You can do the same with the template function although the class way is more flexible.
printOpenStreetMap($geodata);
````
This would create one marker. If you need more add more arrays to the array above.
